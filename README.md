# License-plate-detection-OCR
License Plate Detection (LPD) project driven by machine learning (ML) technologies, specifically leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project excels in precise license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for accurate alphanumeric extraction. Additionally, it includes an authorization verification module that cross-references extracted license plate information with a predefined list for added security.
